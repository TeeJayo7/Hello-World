        <strong>My Biography</strong> <br>
    My name is Taiwo Joshua. I am a citizen of Nigeria. I come from Ogun State. I attended Potter's Place Nursery and Primary 
       School for both my nursery and primary education. I then attended Easyway Internationl Model College for my Secondary
       School education. I am yet to enter into a tertiary institution.
   
        As we all know, a biography is meant to contain life experiences and achievements, but presently, I have not gone 
        through any life exoerience or achieved anything worth sharing. Check in later to this webpage for future updates. 
        Thank you for your time.
